                    Since I always had a passion for computers and technology, I
                    studied Computer Science at the University of Pretoria where
                    I completed my BSc (Hons) degree in Computer Science in

                    I started at Suremax as Junior Programmer in March 2005,
                    from where I was promoted, in time, first to Senior
                    Programming Analyst and finally to my current position as
                    Product Development Manager. It is my job to oversee the
                    in-house Software Development Life Cycle of X-Store and to
                    look after our client’s needs on a software level. My team

                    Lydia Badenhorst (de Villiers) was born 19 February 1968 in
                    Ladybrand. She matriculated in Pretoria, Oos-Moot High
                    School in 1985, obtained her Executive Secretary Diploma in

                    She truly believes that achieving your dreams, is the most
                    awesome fuel for the soul! Never before has she felt so good
                    about life. With an increased workload and much more
                    responsibility, she strangely feels calmer, more in control.

                    She is forced on a daily basis to give gratitude for her
                    good health and shared successes.{" "}

                      I believe the key ingredients for success are happiness,
                      inspiration & motivation. So there you have it. What you
                      make of your attitude, happiness and life is up to you.
